    <h1>*MAIN PURPOSE OF OUR CAMPS [ONE DONOR CAN SAVE ONE LIFE]:</h1>
      <u><h3><font color="green">*For your kind information:</font></h3></u>
      <p>Blood donation is a practice when people donate blood to others to help them with their medical conditions. Apart from saving lives, donating blood is also a life saving and humanitarian gesture that displays solidarity with others and a concern for their problems and suffering.

There could be several different reasons behind a person’s requirement of blood. The need for blood could arise due to an illness or an accident. Whatsoever the reason could be; blood donation is the only feasible solution. Blood donation is not only beneficial for the recipient but also helps the donor and the society as well.

Donating blood is an act of concern for those who are in need of life-saving blood. Nothing could value more than blood for a person who requires it for saving his/her own life or for the life of someone he/she truly cares for.

Any healthy individual, who isn’t suffering from any disease, can donate blood; however, there should be a gap of at least three months between two consecutive blood donations.

It is also advisable that individuals below 18 years or above 60 should avoid donating blood. It is also highly advisable to don’t conceal any information regarding your health history and medications, from the doctor supervising the blood donation.

<b><u><h2>*Five Reasons Why You Should Donate Blood:</h2></u></b>
 <font color="blue"><h3>1. Development of new red blood cells</h3></font>
    <p>Within the first 48 hours of blood donation, the donor's body starts replenishing the lost red blood cells. The replenishment process helps in staying healthy and productive at work.</p>

<font color="blue"><h3>2. Reducing risk of heart disease</h3></font>
<p>As per several studies and reports, when there is a rise in the iron level in blood, it raises the chances of heart diseases. People should donate blood from time to time in order to reduce the iron level in the blood.</p>

<font color="blue"><h3>3. Burns calories</h3></font>
<p>Donating blood can burn approximately 650 calories for each pint that is like 450 ml of blood.</p>

<font color="blue"><h3>4. Free blood test</h3></font>
<p>On donating blood, the donor receives a free mini health screening and blood tests.</p>

<font color="blue"><h3>5. How often can one donate blood?</h3></font>
<p>The minimum time advised between two donations is 3 months. This gap helps blood regain the normal haemoglobin count.</p>

<font color="blue"><h3>6.Who can donate blood ?</h3></font>
<p>*The age of the donor must be above 18 years and below 65 years of age. He/she must have a haemoglobin count that is not less than 12.5 g/dl. The Weigh should not less than 45 kgs. One should have a normal body temperature at the time of donation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
*You should always drink lots of water before the donation. Also, keep in mind that you should take a well-balanced meal prior to and after donating blood. This will keep you healthy and fit.
<br>
<br>
<br>
*Transfusion of blood is an essential part of modern health care management. The first Blood Centre was started in India by Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) in 1942 at All India Institute of Hygiene & Public Health, Calcutta (West Bengal).
In 1977, the Blood Centre started operating from the Indian Red Cross Society, National Headquarters (IRCS, NHQ). The Blood Centre is running round the clock and provides the services to the needy patients. It was designated as Regional Blood Centre by State Govt. in 1996 and has been designated as Model Blood Centre in 2010 by National AIDS Control Organization, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt of India and is also certified by the BIS for ISO 9001:2008 and accredited by NABH & NABL.
<br>
<br>
<br>
*The NHQ Blood Centre focuses on encouraging voluntary blood donation. It collects approximately 25000 units of blood annually  sEwhich contributes about 10% of the total blood collected in Delhi. The percentage of voluntary blood collection is above 90% in IRCS as compared to the 20-50% ratio of the total collection made by other Blood Centres of Delhi. The Blood Centre provides 90% of total collection of blood free of service charges to the patients admitted in the General Ward of Govt. Hospitals in Delhi as well as to 975 Thalassaemic patients registered with it (which is about 50% of all the Thalassaemics in Delhi).

<br>
<br>
<br>
*The IRCS (NHQ) Blood Centre is fully equipped to collect blood at its premises and also has mobile teams, which go out frequently to hold Blood Donation Camps. The blood collected is tested for HIV I & II, HBs Ag, HCV, VDRL & Malaria. Blood grouping with Rh D and Antibodies Testing (three cell panel) is conducted by fully automated advance technology. To ensure effective utilization of blood, besides supplying whole blood, Red Cross also has the facility of component separation that provides different components of blood, like fresh frozen plasma, platelet rich plasma, platelet concentrate, packed cells, cryoprecipitate and platelet aphaeresis.</p>

There will be at least 3 metre gap between the two couches and at one time there will be no more than three people allowed in the camp. The vans will be disinfected on a regular basis.</td>
